# BeagleBoard.org BeagleBone AI
_Fast track to Embedded Artificial Intelligence_

[BeagleBone AI](https://beagleboard.org/ai) is built on the proven BeagleBoard.org® open source Linux approach, BeagleBone® AI has the form-factor of a miniature single-board computer (SBC) with the power of a full-on industrial computer workhorse. Based on the Texas Instruments AM5729, developers have access to the powerful SoC with the ease of BeagleBone® Black header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone® AI makes it easy to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life via the TI C66x digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an optimized TIDL machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools. Focused on everyday automation in industrial, commercial and home applications.

As a general rule, we don't encourage use of this or other off-the-shelf single board computers in commercial products without engaging with a manufacturer to create a supplier agreement and make sure that you can get material as your business demands. Further, we do update the design on occasions where we find it necessary and won't guarantee a supply of older revisions, though we do seek periodic manufacturing of all of our boards for a period of roughly 10 years and will make design changes to replace obsolete parts and that may impact your usage. If you do opt to use it in a product, you take full responsibility for that product.
